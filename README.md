👋 Hi, I'm Shinonn

I’m a developer who focuses on building systems that stay manageable in the long run.
Most of my work revolves around designing clear workflows, structuring complex logic, and keeping codebases understandable as they grow.

I currently work with Frappe and build internal systems, while exploring small side projects using various tools and languages.
I prefer simplicity in both architecture and execution, and I value maintainability more than clever techniques.

If you share similar ideas or want to discuss system design, feel free to reach out.
