# 💫 About Me:
Hello, I am Siwat Sroisuwan, though you can call me C. I am based in Thailand. I enjoy exploring and building systems, ranging from conceptual design to their underlying structure. I naturally approach problems from a structural perspective, breaking down complex ideas into clear and manageable components. I am comfortable working with logical analysis, system design, and connecting concepts across different domains. I enjoy learning new technologies and am particularly interested in understanding how systems operate behind the scenes rather than simply using them at a surface level. My development philosophy emphasizes clarity, flexibility, and building solutions that can grow and adapt over time. I believe meaningful creation is not just about functionality, but also about understanding the reasoning and architecture that support it.
